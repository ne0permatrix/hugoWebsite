# Why should you read this article? <br>
If you can't retain and apply what you have read into making your life better or solving problems better, reading this can give you some insight on what you can do to actually remember what you read and not only that to store it in your knowledge bank, long term memory, ready-to-be used whenever you need it.        

Accumalating knowledge in your long term memory can be very useful because it can serve as a building block or foundation knowledge for you to build upon when learning a more complicated concept/topic.       

## **Level 1 : THE MUGGLE** <br>
*Passive reading with very minimum engagement.*         
      
We experience this stage when we were young. At this stage, we just read passively without engaging the material what we are reading. This works ok with fiction. However, if we want to read non-fiction, lear n from what we read, and be able to apply that knowledge, we should do more than just passive reading.      

## **Level 2 : THE SQUID** <br>
*Reading and making some highlighting and underlining.*         
     
At this point, we become a bit more engaged with what we are readying by highlighting and underlining what resonates with us. However, these two techniques don't really help with our memorization of the stuffs we read. First, by highlighting alone we don't really remember better or worse we don't remember at all. Second, what we have highlighted or underlined normally ends up hidden away.     

## **Level 3 : HUFFLEPUFF** <br>
*Reading while having a systematic system to review your highlight.*       
    
Highlighting alone doesn't really do us much. We need to review it. Nowsaday, there are applications whose function is to keep note of all your highlight and send you a set amount of radom note to read each morning in most case via email. Guess what we normally end up doing with those email after a while?    

## **Level 4 : RAVENCLAW** <br>
*Reading with a notetaking tool to bring all our highlight in one place.*       
     
Now that we have all of our highlight in one place. We might hope that we will be able to reviwe it more often. Reality could be that this step is still passive. We might find ourselves not reviewing our highlight that often or not at all.    

## **Level 5 : DUMBLEDORE'S ARMY** <br>
*Reading and taking quick note along.*      

Here we start to become better engaged with what we are reading by simply taking quick note. While we are reading, we can pause, close the book or turn off the device, and then write down a short paraphrase of what we have just read.    

In the video, he also designs a system within his notetaking app for taking quick note of:     
- The Book in 3 Sentences
- Impressions
- Who Should Read It?
- How I Discover the Book?
- How the Book Changes Me?
- My Top 3 Qoutes
<br>

Bill Gates takes it to an extra depth with his notetaking method. He takes note on the margin of each page he's reading. Not just random sentences from the page where he finds interesting or important, but a short paraphrase of *what he understand of the concept or what he has just read* plus *how he can apply or relate it to real life and problems*.

## *Level 5 is the sweetspot.*

I have decided and would recommend follow this step for every book, article, or material you read. 

## **Level 6 : ORDER OF THE PHOENIX** <br>
*Reading and doing literature note.*        

In this step, we still follow everything in *Level 5*. In addition, we can have a section to take literature note, our own more detail summary or paraphrase of the book. We can apply this step to those books which we really like or find very related and important to us. For literature note, we take note of all the key ideas, insights, messages, and concepts.      

## **Level 7 : DUMBLEDORE** <br>
*Reading, categorizing, and heavily linking one reading material to another.*         

This is the most detail and engaging level. Not only that we take literature note on what we have read, but we link specific insights, ideas, or concepts from within it to others and organize it/put it away into appropriate and relevant category.

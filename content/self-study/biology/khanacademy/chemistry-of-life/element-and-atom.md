# **Matter, Elements, &  Atoms**

## **What is your body made of?** <br>
Body or Organism < System < Organ < Tissue < Cell < Molecule < **Atom**  
The most basic level of our body is ***Atom***. This is why in Biology we also study about Chemistry.    

## **Matter** <br>  
*Matter* is anything that makes up the universe occupying space and having mass. It is made up of *Elements*.   
*Example: human, animals, table, pen, rock...*     

## **Elements** <br>
*Elements* are made up of *Atom*. They have specific chemical and physical properties.        
*Example: gold element (Au), carbon element (C), hydrogen element (H), oxygen element (O), nitrogen element (N)...*      
<br> 
> There are ***118 elements, only 92 occur naturally***. The rest have been made in the laboratories and are unstable.     

## **Atom** <br>
*Atom* is the most basic fundamental substance and the smallest unit of matter that has all chemical properties of an *Element*. It is made of *Subatomic Particles* : ***Proton***, ***Neutron***, ***Electron***            
*Example: Carbon (C) atom, Hydrogen (H) atom, Oxygen (O) atom...*      

## **Atomic Nuleus** <br>
*Atomic Nuleus* is the core or center of an *Atom*. It is made up of *Proton* and *Neutron*.     

## **Proton** <br>
*Proton* is a positively charged subatomic particle. ***Number of Proton*** determines an element. For example, Carbon (C) consists of 6 protons. This number doesn't change. If it changed, the element would become another element.      

## **Neutron** <br>
*Neutron* is a neutral or uncharged subatomic particle which stays in the *Atomic Nuleus*.      

## **Electron** <br>
*Electron* is a negatively charged subatomic particle which orbit/float around the nuleus of an atom.     

> Atom is hold together by the ***attraction of positively charged proton and negatively charged neutron.***      

## **Atomic Mass Unit (amu) / Dalton** <br>
Because the mass of each subatomic particle is very tiny, it is not convinient to use grams to messure it. Thus they use *Atomic Mass Unit* instead.      

*Proton* and *Neutron* don't have the same charge, but have approximately the same mass about 1.67 x 10^-24 grams or very close of 1 amu.        

*Electron* is much smaller in mass compared to proton and neutron, only 1/1800 of an atomic mass unit.       

## **Uncharged Neutral Atom**
> In an uncharged and neutral atom, the ***number of proton and electron is equal***; therefore, the positive and negative charge cancel each other out.

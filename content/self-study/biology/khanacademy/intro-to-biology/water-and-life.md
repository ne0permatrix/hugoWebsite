# **Water Properties**

## **1.  Polarity**      
###  *What is it?*  
Water molecules are polar. It made of 2 atoms of hydrogen, partialy positive charge and 1 atoms of oxygen, partialy negative charge. These atoms are hold together by ***Covalent Bond***. Electrons gather with the oxygen atom making it ***Electronegative***.  
  
Two different water molecule connect to one another via ***Hydrogen Bong***, where an atom of oxygen from one water molecule attracts to a hydrogen atom of another water molecule.  
### *How do I apply it to real life?*    
***Hydrogen Bond*** is what allows water molecules to remain together as a liquid form at a specific temperature and to move around. 

## **2. Solvent**   
###  *What is it?*      
Water is an excellent solvent. It desolves almost everything which either is polar or ionic.      
### *How do I apply it to real life?*  
For example, water dissolves salt.   

## **3. Specific Heat Capacity**   
###  *What is it?*  
Water has high heat capacity. ***Heat Capacity*** is the amount of heat needed to raise up 1g of liquid substance by 1 degree celcius.  
### *How do I apply it to real life?*  
Because it takes a lot of energy to raise water level by 1 degree, water helps regulate temperature in an environment. For example, water helps keep temperature in a pond constant from day to night regardless of the changing atmospheric temperature.    

## **4. Heat of Vaporization** 
###  *What is it?*   
Water has high heat of vaporization. ***Heat of Vaporization*** is the amount of energy needed to change 1g of a liquid substance to a gas at a constant temperature.    
### *How do I apply it to real life?*  
In hot sunny day, we as human sweat. This mechanism helps us to cool our bodies as excess body sweat evaporates off our skin taking along with it the heat. 

## **5. Cohesion and Adhesion Properties** 
###  *What is it?*    
***Cohesion Property*** is the attraction of molecules for other molecules of the same kind.       
***Adhesion Property*** is attraction of molecules for other molecules of a different kind    
### *How do I apply it to real life?*
Because of ***Cohesion Property*** water molecules are held together very strong and tight.   
Because of ***Adhesion Property*** water can travel from the roots of the tree to different parts of the tree.   

## **6. Density**   
###  *What is it?*     
Density is a mass per unit valume of a substance. Water is less dense as a solid(ice) than as a liquid.   
### *How do I apply it to real life?*  
In winter, the surface of the lake/pond is frozen while the ice is floating on only the top.    

***"Universal Solvent"***  
The idea that water is an *universal solvent* is misleading. Even though water dissolve almost many things that are ionic or polar, but it doesn't dissolve non-polar substance; for example, oil.
